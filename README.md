# Black_Hat_Python

Summary: This is a project to type in the code from "Black Hat Python, 2nd edition" by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold
as part of a book club project, to practice debugging (my own typos), experiment with the programs, and practice Git.

Full source code from the original authors is availalbe on the publisher's site: https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python2E
